WHAT IS CIPP?

	Download CIPP from CPAN or http://spirit.dimedis.de/ and

WHY THIS EXTRA PACKAGE FOR DOCUMENTATION?

	This CIPP language reference manual is an extra package
	because the format is PDF and the uncompressed file has more
	than 500kb. Also not every modification of CIPP leads to
	modification of this documentation.

CONVERED CIPP VERSION

	This documentation covers CIPP up to version 1.90.
	$VERSION="1.90"

THIS IS FREE, BUT WHERE ARE THE SOURCES?

	The original Framemaker sources for this PDF file can
	be retrieved from the spirit Webserver
	
		http://spirit.dimedis.de/
	
	This site will be online March 1999.
