NAME
    CIPP::Doc - CgI Perl Preprocessor Documentation

DESCRIPTION
    CIPP is a Perl module for translating CIPP sources to pure
    Perl programs. CIPP defines a HTML embedding language also
    called CIPP which has powerful features for CGI and database
    developers.

    Many standard CGI and database operations (and much more)
    are covered by CIPP, so the developer does not need to code
    them again and again.

WHY CIPP::Doc?
    This is a extra package, because the format of the documentation
    is PDF and the uncompressed file has more than 500kb. Also not
    every modification of CIPP leads to modification of the
    documentation.

    The CIPP::Manual module is part of the CIPP distribution. It is
    the POD version of the CIPP Reference chapter.
