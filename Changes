Revision history for CIPP documentation:

2.11  Thu Sep 30 1999
	- now the whole documentation is in English. Thanks to
	  Stefan Eissing for proofreading some chapters.
	  Please be patient: English is not my motherlanguage,
	  so there may be some grammatical errors. If you find
	  mistakes, please tell me, I will fix them as soon
	  as possible.

1.93  Thu Feb 25 1999
	- hint about use of NOQUOTE option of <?INCINTERFACE> command
	  for passing array, hash and reference parameters

1.90  Sat Jan 16 1999
	- first version published on CPAN, in german language
